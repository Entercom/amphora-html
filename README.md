# Amphora HTML

The HTML renderer for [Amphora](https://github.com/nymag/amphora) as part of the [Amphora Next](https://github.com/nymag/amphora/projects/1) project. This module is under active development and work is proceeding on the `develop` branch.

## Basic Concepts

  - Amphora handles only JSON data
  - Amphora renderers convert data into markup of any variety (HTML, XML, Amp, etc.)
  - These modules can created to be standalone apps or plugged into an Amphora instance

## Roadmap
For updates on progress please [check the project page](https://github.com/nymag/amphora-html/projects/1).
